Created using Python3.4 for 64 bit, Biopython 1.64 for 64 bit, xlwt future 0.8.
The program name is REIDv0.3. (Restriction Enzyme Identify version 0.3)
Created by Charles Gregory.

-Only fasta files.The fasta file must be in the same directory as the program.

-If it isn't, the Movefile program can do that or the REIDv0.3-multiple can.
However, you must pull these fasta files from a seperate directory
and it will pull all those files in that directory.

-Enter the complete file name including the fasta extension.

-If you use the multiple prgram it will automatically analyze
all the .fasta files in the program directory.

-Check the restriction enzyme(s) you want and whether you want
restriction sites or fragments or both.

-Click Analyze.

-The program will print the location of the RE site cuts and fragments in an
excel document saved to the directory of the program.

-If nothing is printed there are no sites.
-
If you use the multiple program each .fasta will have a seperate sheet
in the excel file.

This program was created in an effort to make a connection
between clusters of fragment sizes from restricion enzyme digest of 
bacteriophages and bacteriophage clusters.
